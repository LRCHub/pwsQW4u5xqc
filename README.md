[00:25.21] Some "once upon a time"
[00:27.36] Is not where our myth belongs
[00:30.61] Through the faded lines of words
[00:32.78] And rhyme is a hidden song
[00:36.03] Though fractured deeply
[00:37.48] Worn by sorrows from time and time again
[00:41.41] Take my hand and enter our "pretend"
[00:59.41] 
[01:05.54] By star-lit skies, endlessly writing
[01:09.22] Inviting those along
[01:12.02] Lost souls who hear our song when gone astray
[01:15.97] Though strife's part of life
[01:18.16] Stay unafraid, now
[01:20.35] When forces say, "Behave"
[01:22.21] We say instead, "Be brave"
[01:35.21] 
[01:26.87] In a desperate shout, our souls reach out
[01:29.62] With pen toward every page
[01:31.99] We ignite, come alive like a starry night
[01:34.43] With a fire no doubts can take away
[01:37.63] Got no fairy tale where "love prevails"
[01:40.58] Though painful, now we move endlessly on
[01:42.70] By the light- your spark
[01:44.91] Head first, into the dark
[01:57.41] 
[01:58.92] Some "once upon a time"
[02:00.62] Is not where a voice gets heard
[02:04.23] Will the faded lines of speeding time
[02:06.41] Make us flightless birds?
[02:09.39] When pen is running dry
[02:10.77] A soul on fire is driven to react
[02:14.77] And when burning flames attack
[02:17.25] We will never fade to black
[02:30.75] 
[02:20.12] Though fake, it seems
[02:21.17] Not a dream or a trick of light
[02:25.22] Always vacancy, take a seat
[02:27.33] Iit's our story's time
[02:30.64] A world is brought to life, through voices five
[02:33.15] And as "real" as they say
[02:36.01] Pen as sword, we're choosing fate
[02:38.25] We can never lose our way
[02:50.75] 
[02:41.68] By star-lit skies, endlessly writing
[02:45.13] Inviting those along
[02:48.46] Lost souls who hear our song when gone astray
[02:51.96] Though strife's part of life
[02:54.29] Stay unafraid, now
[02:56.23] When forces say "behave"
[02:58.06] We say instead, "Be brave"
[03:11.06] 
[03:13.57] Defiant 'til the end, I'll stay killing to sing
[03:18.96] I'll dance in burning embers unyielding
[03:21.17] Your love's given me wings
[03:24.01] While learning to remember
[03:25.37] The good times we bring
[03:29.73] Our ocean's finally full of life
[03:31.91] Set every vital piece in motion, now we write
[03:54.41] 
[03:37.28] In a desperate shout, our souls reach out
[03:39.86] With pen toward every page
[03:42.32] We ignite, come alive
[03:44.10] Like a starry night
[03:45.96] With a fire no doubts can take away
[03:47.01] Write a fairy tale
[03:49.57] Where "love prevails"
[03:50.92] Cliched, maybe, we move joyfully on
[03:52.77] By the light- your spark
[03:55.68] Hopeless days are just a part of being free
[03:58.90] We wrote it all by heart
[04:10.90] 
[04:04.37] And smile, side by side among the stars
